### Things learned/practiced about ES2015 with this tiny useless app:
- Promises
- New data structs - Map, Set etc.
- Fat arrow functions (lexical this)
- let/const
- Functional programming (filter/map/reduce)
- Dom manipulation without third party libs (except 3-4 rows of jQuery, because lazyness, u know..)
- Classes/OOP - dependency injection, separation of concerns, strategy pattern, custom event dispatching etc.
- Made custom event dispatcher and utilized the power of event-driven programming
- Practiced refactoring and progressive development

Time it took to build: < 2 days

Still lots of bugs and improvements, but the overall idea of this app was to practice/learn some concepts and new things about ES2015 as fast as possible.

No demo of the app, sorry. But you can download and run the index.html file -> it's that simple. Have fun.
